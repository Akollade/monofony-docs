Behaviour driven development is an approach to software development process that provides software development and management teams
with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development. The awesome part of BDD is its ubiquitous language,
which is used to describe the software in English-like sentences of domain specific language.

The application's behaviour is described by scenarios, and those scenarios are turned into automated test suites with tools such as Behat.

Monofony behaviours are fully covered with Behat scenarios and if you want
to understand some aspects of Monofony better, or are wondering how to configure something, we strongly recommend
reading them. They can be found in the ``features/`` directory of your project.

We use [FriendsOfBehat/SymfonyExtension](https://github.com/FriendsOfBehat/SymfonyExtension) to integrate Behat with Symfony.
